<P>This is a <B>lengthy</B> paragraph with various <I>tag patterns</I> to test the robustness of the <T>tag checker</T>. It includes <A>properly nested tags</A>, as well as some <B><I>overlapping tags</I></B>. There are also <X>invalid tags</X> like <1>numeric</1> and <a>lowercase</a> ones. Some tags <Open>are left open, while others are closed without opening</Close>. We also have <A href="test">tags with attributes</A> which should be treated as plain text. There's even an attempt at <SC RIP T>sneaking in a script tag</SCRIPT>. < Spaces>Spaces in tags</ Spaces> are also tested, as well as <A></ A>extra spaces in closing tags</A>. Let's not forget about <B><I><U>deeply nested</I></U></B> tags and <B>improperly <<i>nested</B></i>> ones. Finally, we'll include some <ðŸ’¡>emoji tags</ðŸ’¡> and <@>special character tags</@> to really push the limits. This paragraph < ends>with a dangling opening tag.</P>
<X>Welcome to the <B>ultimate</B> tag checker test! Here we have <I>italic text</I> mixed with <B><U>bold and underlined</U></B> content. We'll throw in some <A href="https://example.com">invalid attribute tags</A> and <1>numeric tags</1> to spice things up. Don't forget about <a>lowercase tags</a> and <CAPS>uppercase tags</CAPS>. Let's add some <B><I>overlapping</B></I> tags and <X><Y>properly nested</Y></X> ones too. We'll sneak in a <ðŸ’¡>fancy emoji tag</ðŸ’¡> and a <@>special character tag</@>. Time for some </C>closing without opening and <O>opening without closing. How about <A<B>>nested brackets</A</B>> and <<D>>double brackets<</D>>? Let's not forget <A></ A>extra spaces</A> and <B>mismatched <I>tag</B> orders</I>. Finally, we'll end with a dangling opening bracket <.</X>
